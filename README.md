# Exploring Thorax and Wing Traits: A Classification Study of Drosophila Species

Many datasets on Australian Drosophila (fruit fly) species have been collated and studied to investigate questions around climate adaptation, species distribution limits, and population genetics (Sandra B. Hangartner and Griffin, 2015). In this report, we investigate one such dataset (Loeschcke, Bundgaard, and Barker, 2000) which has collected various thorax and wing measurements, and focus on the classification of two such species, Aldrichi and Buzzatii, based on these traits.
